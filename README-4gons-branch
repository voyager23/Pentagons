README - 4gons branch

This is the 4gons branch.

Investigate away to construct pentagons according to Stewart's Cube rules.

From the list of Nodes, conduct a 4 way search to find 'open' 4 sided
figures. Two of these can be overlapped to form a Pentagon.

Preliminary results match - however this seems to be a much slower
algorithm.
